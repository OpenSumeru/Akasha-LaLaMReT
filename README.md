# LaLaMReT - Large Language Model Reasoning Test

**LaLaMReT (Akasha LaLaMReT)** is an open benchmarking project designed to evaluate the **mathematical, physical, and programming reasoning** capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The goal is to assess the depth of logical reasoning, problem-solving, and analytical skills exhibited by LLMs in these domains.

## üöÄ Features
- **Mathematical Reasoning**: Tests covering algebra, calculus, discrete math, and more.
- **Physics Problem-Solving**: Conceptual and numerical physics challenges.
- **Programming & Algorithmic Thinking**: Code debugging, algorithm implementation, and complexity analysis.
- **Scalability**: New topics can be added via pull requests (PRs).

## üéØ Evaluation Methodology
Each test case is scored based on the following criteria:

1. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Is the final answer correct?
2. **Physics Understanding**: Does the solution demonstrate correct physical intuition?
3. **Programming Correctness**: Is the code syntactically and logically valid?
4. **Optimization & Efficiency**: Does the model suggest an optimal solution?
5. **Explainability**: Can the model provide reasoning for its answer?

**Scoring System:**
