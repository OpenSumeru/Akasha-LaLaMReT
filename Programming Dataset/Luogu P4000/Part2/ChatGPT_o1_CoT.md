Piecing together the Pisano period strategy for efficiently calculating large Fibonacci numbers modulo a relatively small prime. This involves leveraging periodic patterns to simplify the calculation process.

I’m gathering info on the Pisano period for prime modulus, noting the period length can be up to 6 times the modulus. This creates a robust framework for efficient calculations.

Evaluating the 6*m upper bound for simpler Fibonacci calculations, where m is the modulus, reveals it scales to 12.88 billion for m < 2^31. This limits feasibility for certain time constraints.

Evaluating matrix exponentiation for large exponents and its feasibility, considering storage limits and computational constraints due to the massive size of the exponent. Progressing through these thoughts reveals significant challenges.

Considering large n mod p, using the Pisano period to reduce to n mod T simplifies the exponentiation by transforming it into f_{n mod T} mod p. This method holds potential for efficient calculation.

I’m evaluating a naive method to find the Pisano period T by generating Fibonacci mod p and spotting the "0,1" pattern. This method is computationally intense but potentially possible with optimal programming.

I’m piecing together a strategy to quickly compute the Pisano period using prime factorization of p and the Chinese remainder theorem. This method requires managing up to 46,340 steps.

Calculating Fibonacci mod p with matrix exponentiation is intriguing, especially using binary or fast doubling methods. However, managing the vast exponent limits practicality.

Taking a closer look, calculating T naively with 1.26e10 steps is impractical for typical problems. Fast C++ with vectorization might halve this time to around 10 seconds on a typical machine.

I'm gathering info on linear recurrence sequences mod p, considering Floyd's or Brent's algorithm. These methods, however, may still place the complexity at threshold T.

I'm working through methods like the "power of the Fibonacci Q-matrix" and examining properties of T to streamline the process, as T divides p-1 or p+1 if p is prime.

Evaluating feasibility

I’m weighing the practicality of using a naive method to compute T for competitive programming. With T reaching up to 12.8 billion, optimized C++ might manage this in 2.5 seconds on a 2.5 GHz CPU.

Tracking progress

Interestingly enough, to manage the sequence of 0,1 efficiently, I’m focusing on just the last two values and an index, avoiding the impractical memory requirement of 12.8 GB.

Advancing the approach

I’m working on efficiently computing Fibonacci sequences by storing just the last two values and innovating with the fast doubling technique, which needs O(log n) steps.

Tackling immense computational hurdles

Hmm, I’m thinking about how base p or base 2 representation simplifies the task. Repeated squaring could handle large exponent n, but the logarithmic complexity still seems daunting.

Identifying the solution

I’m working through the feasibility of pinpointing period T to simplify n mod T, then calculating Fibonacci(n mod T) mod p quickly using fast doubling or matrix exponentiation.

Navigating complexity

With T up to p^2 - 1 or 6p, and p < 2^31, the upper bound balloons to roughly 4.6e18, making a direct approach impractical. Hm, that's intricate.

Tackling large inputs

I’m reading n as a string for precision, then calculating T using the Pisano period function, which can take up to 6p steps in the worst case.

Crunching the numbers

OK, let me see. Calculating T with the Pisano period function seems efficient. Using repeated modulo reduction on n's string form could handle the large size, though it's quite intensive.

Understanding the constraints

Hmm, I’m thinking about the bottleneck being the Pisano period calculation and its influence on the entire process. This piques my interest, hinting at areas for improvement.

Unveiling the bottleneck

The critical slowdown in calculating Fibonacci(n mod T) mod p is pinpointed to finding the Pisano period T. Mudging forward, let's explore efficient methods for this calculation.

Streamlining the challenge

I'm considering an efficient method to find the Pisano period T, especially for large primes p. This approach should ideally avoid exponential time pegged to n's length or T's size.

Breaking down the time limits

I’m recognizing the practical implications of calculating Fibonacci numbers. With a 10-second window, I’m considering direct Fibonacci computation. Longer calculations would need more sophisticated approaches.

Implementing efficient strategies

I’m curious about managing large Pisano periods for prime p by focusing on divisors of p-1 or p+1, aiming to streamline calculations and ensure the process stays within practical time limits.

Navigating factorization and LCM

Laying out the options: factorizing p, applying known formulas for prime powers, and combining via Chinese remainder theorem. This approach could streamline managing large Pisano periods effectively.

Navigating the options

We’re looking at the naive method for T and a fast doubling method for final computation, keeping in mind the importance of precise C++ coding.

Implementing the code

I’m crafting C++ code to find the Pisano period for any prime p. It leverages fast doubling or matrix exponentiation for efficient n modulo p, foreseeably avoiding overflow with intermediate results.

Mapping out the steps

I’m working through a C++ program to compute Fibonacci numbers modulo p using a fast doubling method. The program reads input, calculates the Pisano period, and reduces n modulo T for efficient computation.

Advancing the strategy

Given the problem's lack of constraints, opting for the naive method to pinpoint the Pisano period appears sufficient. The goal is to ensure stability for p=1 or p=2.
