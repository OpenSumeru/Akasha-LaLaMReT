Tackling large Fibonacci

I’m thinking through how to compute Fibonacci(n) mod p for n up to 10^30,000,000. Instead of direct methods, leveraging the Pisano period for modulo p provides a practical approach.

Assessing matrix exponentiation

Considering matrix exponentiation mod p for large Fibonacci numbers, but 69 million matrix multiplications seems impractical. This underlines the challenges of handling such large computations efficiently.

Calculating the Pisano period

OK, let’s figure out Fibonacci(n) mod p by mapping out the Pisano period for p. This method ensures the calculations stay practical and manageable.

Strategizing the Pisano period

Taking a closer look at the Pisano period for large primes, this method ensures our calculations stay practical. Now, I’m figuring out efficient strategies for large computation.

Applying factorization

For primes up to 2^31, factoring to identify the Pisano period becomes feasible, leveraging the Carmichael function and the least common multiple of prime power periods.

Streamlining calculations

I'm piecing together factoring p up to 2.1e9 and using matrix exponentiation with n mod lcm to keep calculations feasible and practical. This method enhances overall computational efficiency.

Ensuring feasibility

OK, I’m noting that reducing n mod the Pisano period length makes matrix exponentiation practical, especially since the matrix multiplication for 2x2 matrices is quite manageable.

Computing Fibonacci efficiently

I'm blending established methods with practical strategies to tackle large Fibonacci calculations. This combination should streamline the process and make progress easier to achieve.

Breaking down the strategy

I’m figuring out Fibonacci modulo m by factoring p, calculating prime power periods, and using LCM to reduce n mod the largest feasible period.

Assessing factorization feasibility

OK, I’m using a sqrt method for factoring p, examining prime or quadratic residue properties, and merging these with streamlined exponential computation. Progress is steady, but progress remains.

Flawless execution

I’m working through factoring p into primes, calculating Fibonacci sequence lengths mod each prime power, and finding the LCM of these lengths to ensure the solution's feasibility.

Simplifying calculations

I’m noting that computing Fibonacci sequence lengths mod each prime power and finding the LCM simplifies it to O(log L). Matrix exponentiation then helps efficiently determine the result.

Determining minimal period

I’m focusing on calculating the Legendre symbol to identify the quadratic residue of 5 modulo p. This leads to identifying divisors of p-1 or p+1 that give the minimal period.

Navigating computational challenges

Mapping out the solution involves handling potential prime powers and their prime factorizations. Despite the complexity, this method remains efficient for large n and relatively smaller p.
