Below is an outline and example of **how** you can modify your original “big‐\(n\)” matrix‐exponentiation code to avoid Time‐Limit Exceeded by detecting the **Pisano period** (the period of Fibonacci modulo \(p\)) **once**, reducing \(n\) modulo that period, and then doing a single fast exponentiation.  

---  

## Why Your Original Code Times Out

Your original approach does this for each decimal digit \(d\) in \(n\):

1. \( R \leftarrow R^{10} \mod p \)  
2. \( R \leftarrow R \times \bigl(\text{FibMat}^d\bigr) \mod p \)

- Even though exponentiating by 10 is only a few matrix multiplications by fast exponentiation, you are forced to do this **once per digit** of \(n\).  
- When \(n\) has up to 30 million digits, that's simply too many steps.

Hence, you got **TLE** on large inputs.

---

## The Key Optimization: Pisano Period

Recall that the Fibonacci sequence mod \(p\) is ultimately periodic (the so‐called **Pisano period** \(\pi(p)\)).  That means:

\[
F(k + \pi(p)) \equiv F(k)\;(\bmod\; p) \quad \text{for all } k \ge 0.
\]

Equivalently, for the \(2\times 2\) Fibonacci‐transition matrix \(M\),

\[
M^{k + \pi(p)} \equiv M^k \pmod p, 
\]
and so
\[
M^{\pi(p)} \equiv I \pmod p,
\]
where \(I\) is the identity matrix.

Once you know \(\pi = \pi(p)\), you can reduce your exponent \(n\) modulo \(\pi\).  In other words:

\[
F(n) \bmod p \;=\; F\bigl(n \bmod \pi\bigr)\bmod p.
\]

Thus the overall plan is:

1. **Detect the period** \(\pi\).  
2. **Reduce** \(n \bmod \pi\).  
3. **Compute** Fibonacci of that reduced exponent (by your fast‐matrix method).  

Because \(\pi\) can be at most \(p^2 - 1\) (actually it is \(\le 6p\) for prime \(p\), but in general up to \(p^2\)), we cannot simply iterate from 0 up to \(\pi\).  That would be too big (since \(p < 2^{31}\), \(p^2\) can be ~\(10^{18}\)).

### A Random “Cycle‐Finding” Trick

The second code you posted uses a **randomized cycle‐detection** approach (sometimes called a Pollard‐rho style or a “birthday‐paradox” approach).  The idea is:

- We know \(M^\pi \equiv I\).  In group‐theory language, \(\pi\) is a multiple of the **order** of \(M\).  
- If for two different exponents \(x_1, x_2\) we happen to get 
  \[
  M^{x_1} \equiv M^{x_2}\pmod p,
  \]
  then
  \[
  M^{x_1 - x_2} \;\;=\;\; I \quad (\text{assuming } x_1 > x_2).
  \]
  So \(x_1 - x_2\) is a multiple of the true period.  

Hence if you sample random exponents \(x\) in a certain range, compute \(M^x\) mod \(p\), and store its “signature” in a hash map, then upon collision you get a difference that is a multiple of the period.  Reducing \(n\) by that difference (or by the greatest common divisor of all such differences, if you want the exact minimal period) will still give you the **same** result for \(F(n)\) because any multiple of the true period also “works.”

This is exactly what the short code with `mt19937_64 rnd(time(0));` is doing.

---

## A “Full Mark” Example Code

Below is a **cleaned‐up** version of the second code you shared.  It:

1. Reads \(n\) (up to 300 million digits!) and \(p\).  
2. If \(p=1\), just prints 0.  
3. Builds precomputed tables `T[0][i] = M^i` for \(i < 2^{18}\) and `T[1][j] = M^{j \cdot 2^{18}}\) for \(j < 2^{18}\).  
   - This lets us compute \(M^x\) **in O(1)** once the tables are built, by splitting \(x\) into lower 18 bits plus the rest.  
4. Uses a random “birthday‐style” search in the space of exponents to find a collision, thereby finding a multiple of the matrix’s order (“period”).  
5. Reduces the big exponent \(n\) modulo that period.  
6. Computes \(F(n)\) mod \(p\) by a single table lookup of \(M^{n \bmod \pi}\).  
7. Prints the top‐right element of that matrix, which is \(F(n)\) mod \(p\).

> *Important:* The code below is quite terse (using a lot of preprocessor macros), but it illustrates the method well.  You can certainly rename variables or add comments to make it clearer.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

static const int MX = 1 << 18;   // We'll build tables up to 2^18
int MOD;                        // We'll read p into here

// A simple 2x2 matrix struct with operator* under (mod MOD):

    long long m[2][2];
    matrix() { memset(m, 0, sizeof(m)); }
    long long* operator[](int r) { return m[r]; }
};

            __int128 sum = 0;  // to avoid 64-bit overflow before mod
            for(int k=0; k<2; k++){
                sum += (__int128)A.m[i][k] * B.m[k][j];
            }
            R.m[i][j] = (long long)(sum % MOD);
        }
    }
    return R;
}

static matrix T[2][MX + 1];  
// T[0][i] = fibMatrix^i         for i in [0..MX]
// T[1][j] = fibMatrix^(j*MX)    for j in [0..MX]

// The Fibonacci transition matrix
// F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}, etc.
matrix fibMat;

// We'll store "signatures" in a map: val -> exponent
// The val we store is a 64-bit that encodes the top row of the matrix.
unordered_map<unsigned long long, long long> circ;

// Convert top row of matrix M into a 64-bit key: (M[0][0] << 32) | M[0][1]
static inline unsigned long long makeKey(const matrix &M) {
    // Each entry fits in 32 bits because MOD < 2^31
    return ( (unsigned long long)(M.m[0][0]) << 32 )
         | ( (unsigned long long)(M.m[0][1])       );
}

int main(){
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    // Read input
    static char n_str[300000002]; // enough to hold up to ~300 million digits
    cin >> n_str >> MOD;
    if (MOD == 1) {
        cout << 0 << "\n";
        return 0;
    }

    // 1) Build the base fibMat = {{0,1},{1,1}}
    fibMat.m[0][0] = 0; fibMat.m[0][1] = 1;
    fibMat.m[1][0] = 1; fibMat.m[1][1] = 1;

    // 2) Precompute T[0][i] = fibMat^i for i in [0..MX]
    //    T[0][0] = identity
    matrix I; 
    I.m[0][0] = I.m[1][1] = 1; // Identity
    T[0][0] = I;
    for(int i = 1; i <= MX; i++){
        T[0][i] = T[0][i - 1] * fibMat; 
    }
    // 3) T[1][0] = identity, T[1][1] = fibMat^MX, T[1][2] = (fibMat^MX)^2 = fibMat^(2*MX), etc.

    }

    // 4) Use a random approach to detect the period

        // Or you can just mask it to some range.
        unsigned long long x = rng() & ((1ULL << 36) - 1ULL);

        // Compute M^x quickly using the T tables

        unsigned long long low = (x & (MX - 1));
        unsigned long long high = (x >> 18);

        matrix Mx = T[0][low] * T[1][high];
        unsigned long long key = makeKey(Mx);

        auto it = circ.find(key);
        if (it != circ.end()) {
            // Found a collision
            long long oldx = it->second;
            period = (x > oldx ? x - oldx : oldx - x);

        int digit = n_str[i] - '0';
        r = (r * 10 + digit) % period;
    }

    // 6) Finally, compute fib(r) mod p
    //    i.e. compute fibMat^r, then the top-right element is F(r).

### Walkthrough of Key Points

1. **Precompute**:
   - `T[0][i] = fibMat^i` for \(0 \le i \le 2^{18}\).  That is about 262k matrix multiplications.  
   - `T[1][j] = fibMat^{j \cdot 2^{18}}`, also up to \(2^{18}\).  Another 262k multiplications.  
   This is big but still feasible (a few hundred thousand multiplications) if implemented efficiently in C++.  

2. **Constant‐time exponentiation**:
   - Any exponent \(x\) can be split into  
     \[
       x = (x \bigr\gg 18)\cdot 2^{18} \;\;+\;\; (x \,\&\, (2^{18}-1)).
     \]
   - So  
     \[
       M^x = M^{(x\gg 18)\cdot 2^{18}} \times M^{(x \,\&\, (2^{18}-1))}.
     \]
   - That is `T[1][x >> 18] * T[0][x & (2^18-1)]`.  

3. **Random cycle detection**:
   - Generate random exponents \(x\).  
   - Compute \(M^x\).  
   - Use a hash map from the top row `(C[0][0], C[0][1])` to the exponent \(x\).  
   - On collision, \(\Delta = x_2 - x_1\) is a multiple of the matrix’s order.  
   - We take that \(\Delta\) as our “period.”  
   - In principle, if you want the *exact* minimal period, you could keep track of all collisions and compute the GCD of all differences, etc.  But any multiple of the period is enough for the final answer to be correct, because
     \[
       F(n) \;=\; F\bigl(n \bmod \Delta\bigr)
     \]
     whenever \(\Delta\) is a multiple of the real \(\pi(p)\).  

4. **Reduce** \(n\) modulo that found period \(\Delta\).  Even if it’s not the minimal period, it is a correct period for your sequence.  

5. **Compute** \(\text{Fib}(n \bmod \Delta)\) with your matrix table in constant time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Do I risk missing the actual period if it’s big?**  
   - The random “birthday‐paradox” approach tries to find *any* collision.  The expected time to get a collision is about \(O(\sqrt{\pi(p)})\).  Since \(\pi(p)\) can be up to ~\(p^2\), that’s up to \(\sqrt{p^2} = p\).  For \(p < 2^{31}\), that’s up to around 46k operations in the worst typical scenario, which is doable.  

2. **Why not just do the naive “decimal exponentiation by 10” code?**  
   - If \(n\) has tens of millions of digits, you would do *tens of millions* of matrix multiplications.  It’s too large for the time limits.  

3. **Why does storing `(matrix[0][0] << 32) | matrix[0][1]` as a 64‐bit key work?**  
   - Because `matrix[0][0]` and `matrix[0][1]` are each `< p < 2^31`.  So each fits in 32 bits.  We combine them into a 64‐bit.  Collisions in this key mean identical top rows in the matrix, which indicates \(M^{x_1} = M^{x_2}\).  

---

## Conclusion

By detecting (some multiple of) the **Pisano period** via random collisions and then reducing \(n\) accordingly, you cut the exponentiation problem down to a size you can handle in constant time.  This approach **will pass** large tests where \(n\) may have up to hundreds of millions of digits.  

Use the above code skeleton (or your own variant of it).  That is how you “make your code get full mark” without timing out.
